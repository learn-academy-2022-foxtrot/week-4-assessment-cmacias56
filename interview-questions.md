# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:OOP is a programing model that is used to organize around types of data, some concepts of oop would be objects, classes, and objects. OOP is different from functional programing due to FP is centered more around variables and functions.

Researched answer: : OOP uses class as blueprints for objects. Functional programming is a JS program that has an asortment of meanings such as avoiding shared state, mutating state, side effects, and pure functions. 

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: The only difference between float and integer that an integer is just one solid number (ex: 1,2,3,4) while as a float is the integer plus the remaining amount behind a decimal (ex: 1.1, 1.01, 1. 0001 etc). 3 / 2 without a float method will be (1), with a float will be 1.5.

Researched answer: floats present the numbers after the decimal point whereas integer shows only a rounded number

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: it is a return function that is automatic withing the method, that is different from JS where an implicit return is a return without using a return keyword

Researched answer: Ruby will return the last line automatically , compared to JavaScript that needs the keyword "return" to return a line of code. 

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: a Block in ruby is just a grouping of code (block). Just like other program lang, blocks hold everything such as fuctions, objects, classes, methods and every else you can use in code. 

Researched answer: Ruby block function that passed to a method to return a new outcome. They will have do and end. (i was a bit off..... definitley need do go through this a few times over) 

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: utilize the do-method to extract the value assigned into keys, call for the hash followed by the key and place the value within []

Researched answer: The curly braces contain key value pairs. The values are assigned into keys. Calling the hash followed by a key name within brackets grabs the value associated with that key.
